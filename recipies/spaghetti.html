    <h2>Why Spaghetti</h2>
    <p>Ordinarily, the one meal I am willing to kill over is spaghetti. 
        The one person who comes to mind when I think about spaghetti is my
        grandmother. Her sauce is as thick as her history and the many layers
        to the dish represent the transitions she has had all throughout her life.
        Spaghetti is my go-to meal for heartaches, stress, and happiness. I can 't 
        just eat anyone 's spaghetti or any type of spaghetti. First, it has to be 
        my Mammaw 's (grandmother) spaghetti because she adds the perfect amount of 
        sugar and love into her infamous sauce.
